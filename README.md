## Metadata

The actual parsing of titles done with black magic, battle tested on the whole nyaa site. of course there may be some cases where it fails to parse correctly, please create an issue for those. 

```php
$md = Metadata::createFromTitle("[HorribleSubs] Show By Rock!! S2 - 07 [720p].mkv");

echo $md["name"]; // Show By Rock!! S2
echo $md["group"]; // HorribleSubs
echo $md["type"]; // ep
echo $md["ep"]; // 7
echo $md["resolution"]; // 720p
```

The `Metadata` object is an `ArrayObject` and doesn't define any functions except it's constuctors

### `Metadata::createFromTitle($title): Metadata`

### `Metadata::createFromArray($array): Metadata`
 
Create an `Metadata` object with the given array as properties

## Archiver

Archives the torrents into the correct `TorrentSet`'s can be done stateless (by using `Archiver::archive`) or with state, by creating the `Archiver` object

### `Archiver::archive(Torrent[] $torrents): TorrentSet[]`
 
This function will archive given torrents in separate `TorrentSet`'s and return those, as you would expect it.

All HorribleSubs, Show By Rock!! S2, 720p will be in it's own set, while the 1080p torrents of those will be in a different set.

### `Archiver->addTorrent(Torrent $torrent): bool`

This will return `true` if it's added to a TorrentSet, `false` if a newer version or the same version already exists

Get the `TorrentSet`'s currently in the archive

## TorrentSet

### `TorrentSet->addTorrent(Torrent $torrent): bool`
